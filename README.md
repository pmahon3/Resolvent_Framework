# A Resolvent Framework for Global and Local Nonlinear Semigroups

Determining the resolvent set for linear and nonlinear semigroups is a challenge. Here we approach the problem from an applied perspective, parameterizing local fits to linear semigroups in Banach spaces. We extend the concept to locally linear semigroups and then generalize to global and locally nonlinear semigroups. We attempt to recover an expression of the resolvent set for the corresponding class of resolvent operators.

Applications to dynamical systems, reversibility, and stability, and mathematical logic are discussed.

# Resolvent_Framework
A Resolvent Framework for Global and Local Nonlinear Semigroups

Determining the resolvent set for linear and nonlinear semigroups is a challenge. Here we approach the problem from an applied perspective, parameterizing the local fits to operators of semigroups in Banach spaces. We extend the concept of a linear semigroup to a locally linear semigroup. From there we generalize to global and locally nonlinear semigroups and attempt to recover an expression r of the resolvent set for the corresponding class of resolvent operators.

Applications to dynamical systems, and stability theory, and mathematical logic are discussed.
